# Few-Shot Learning for Fine-Grained Pill Classification
Final Paper for 10417/10617 - Intermediate Deep Learning

Dated 03 December 2021.

This project investigates the ePillD Dataset which consists of 13,000 pill images and 9804 appearance classes (front and back sides of 4,902 pill types). Many of these pills look the same, differing only by a small inscription. Moreover, for many pills only one image exists of each side. In this few and sometimes one-shot learning setting, we create an attention-based multi-headed architecture that achieves considerable fine-grained classification performance on the dataset. We come close to state-of-the-art performance utilizing attention-based techniques in an area of research currently dominated by ResNet architectures.
